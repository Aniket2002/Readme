Hi there! My name is Aniket Bhardwaj and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
As a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, I am passionate about exploring the latest advancements in these fields. Recently, I have started developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects as well.
In addition to my ML and AI interests, I have also worked in web development and have knowledge of C++ and Core Java.
When I'm not busy with programming and tech, I enjoy playing the flute, listening to music, reading novels, and playing badminton.
While I have not yet contributed much to Github, I am excited to start sharing my projects and making a positive impact in the tech community.
